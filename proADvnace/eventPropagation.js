//event propagation refers to the process of how events propagate or travel through the dom hierachy

//in js there are two phases of event propagtion capturing phase and bubbling phase.

//capturing phase:the event starts from the root of the dom and goes down to the target element
//target phase:
//event reaches the target element

//bubbling phase
//the event starts dom the target elemnt bubbles up to the root of the dom
